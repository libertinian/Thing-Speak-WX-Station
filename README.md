# ThingSpeakWXStation
ThingSpeak-integrated weather station using Arduino MKR1000 and Adafruit BME280

This sketch is the amalgation of the Arduino tutorial for using WiFi 101 ThingSpeak Data Uploader (http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/WiFi101ThingSpeakDataUploader) and the Adafruit example sketch for the BME280 breakout board (http://www.adafruit.com/products/2650). 

Currently working on implementing a method to gather sea-level pressure data based on location to improve apparent altitude measurements.
